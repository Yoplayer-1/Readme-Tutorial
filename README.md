# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the .md or .markdown extension


# Text
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!
